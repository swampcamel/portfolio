# _Resume / Portfolio Site_

#### _Resume and Portfolio of Dan Mace, 08/03/2018_

#### By _**Dan Mace**_

## Description

_This site was created to feature the work and background of the developer.  It utilizes HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 4.1.3, jQuery and JavaScript (only as far as required by Bootstrap), and Google Fonts API.  The site contains 4 sections detailing personal information (about), a portfolio (projects), resume area (experience), and knowledge (skills).  Currently, all the navigation links send the user to the same anchor on the page where the toggle-able elements are.  In the future, much of the toggle elements will instead be on separate pages and the links will link to their respective pages._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _To view page, visit https://swampcamel.github.io/portfolio/ ._
* _To access repository, visit https://github.com/swampcamel/portfolio ._
* _To run site offline, clone repository.  Open index.html in the root directory of cloned repository in your preferred browser._
* _IMPORTANT: If attempting to run site offline, you will need to change links and scripts in HEAD of index.HTML to local resources from Bootstrap, JavaScript, Poppers JS, and jQuery for site to function the same as with CDN integration._

## Known Bugs

_When toggles are all visible, the navigation link doesn't actually bring you to the location of the open toggle.  Will need to implement JavaScript if else statement that checks state of toggle and changes the target ID of the nav element based off the toggle state... once I know I how to actually do that._
